# Source for Bit Icons

The Bit Icons Makefile [\_images.mk](_images.mk) will take any .png files in this
directory and resize them to be 64 pixel square images and place them in the
media/bit-icons/ directory.

All bit icon images should come from a separate repo. Puzzle Massive uses the
puzzle-massive-content repo for it's bit icons. See the 'with-content' git
branch.
